# Schoodle

## Project Description

Schoodle is an app for scheduling events with your friends. It is meant to be easy to use without sharing much personal information. Users don't need to create an account to create a link containing proposed event times and then share these with their friends. Friends can then vote on the proposed times so that the organizer knows when most people will be free.
